This plugin works together with http://scoutapp.com to provide insight into the health and performance 
of your Rails application while it runs in production.

It captures metrics silently in the background, imposing negligable overhead itself. 

Scoutapp.com uses the gathered information to give you a heads-up when something changes on your app
(for example, if a certain controller action slows down a lot relative to the same day last week), or if
it looks like your database queries are having problems (for example, if a query is slow because you're missing an index.
